# Practice Practice Practice

So far I have:

  * Renamed a local directory
  * Initiated Git tracking
  * Made a Repo on GitHub
  * Linked the local and remote versions
  * Made documents
  * Added info to the documents
  * Pushed changes to a new branch
  * Done a pull request
  * Merged my changes from the new branch back to master
  * Pulled the changes down to my local machine
  * Switched from new branch back to master
  * Added this readme.md file
  * Total time was about 70 minutes
